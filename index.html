          <h1>The Unromantic Beatles</h1>
          <p>
            All of the 13 tracks in the Beatles' first album, Please Please Me, were love songs.
            That's more than their last 6 albums combined.
            This visualization explores how the proportion of love songs in their albums diminished over time.

            For the purpose of this project, "love song" means any song directly focused on romantic love,
            romantic relationships, or heartbreak. For example, <i>Love Me Do</i> qualifies as a love song,
            but <i>All You Need Is Love</i> does not. Many of their later songs are difficult to classify;
            reach out to me if I got any wrong.
